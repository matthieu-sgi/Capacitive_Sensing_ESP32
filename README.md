# ESP32 capacitive sensing project for [Musical Plant Interface](https://dvic.devinci.fr/projects/plant-based-interface)

This project is a proof of concept for a capacitive sensing interface for musical instruments. It is based on the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) microcontroller. The ESP32 is a low-cost microcontroller with integrated WiFi and Bluetooth. It is a great platform for IoT projects.

The esp32 generate a web server to simplify the calibration. It will embed a SD card to store the calibration data.


The PCB can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/matthieu-sgi/NE555_Musical_Plant_Interface) or in `PCB/NE555_Musical_Plant_Interface` folder.
