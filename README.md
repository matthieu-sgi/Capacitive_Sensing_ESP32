# ESP32 capacitive sensing project for [Musical Plant Interface](https://dvic.devinci.fr/projects/plant-based-interface)

This project is a proof of concept for a capacitive sensing interface for musical instruments. It is based on the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) microcontroller. The ESP32 is a low-cost microcontroller with integrated WiFi and Bluetooth. It is a great platform for IoT projects.

The esp32 generate a web server to simplify the calibration. It will embed a SD card to store the calibration data.

Old package version of the actual code are stored in [old](https://github.com/sn00wden/Capacitive_Sensing_ESP32/tree/master/old) folder.
